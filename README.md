# QM
The QM algorithm is an algorithm for multi-camera pedestrian detection.
The code and demonstration videos of the QM algorithm, as well as the PETS2009 ground truth data created by us, are provided here. 
The QM algorithm is presented in the article: Y. Yan, M. Xu, J.S. Smith, M. Shen and J. Xi, Multicamera pedestrian detection using logic minimization, Pattern Recognition, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patcog.2020.107703
